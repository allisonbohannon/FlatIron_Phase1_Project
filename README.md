# MyReads
 Find out stats about what kind of reader you are! 

 ## Project Philosophy: 
 This project was made with the intention of giving a user the ability to add to a list of read books to see trends in their reading habits. 

 ## Features: 
 * Ability to search through millions of books through OpenLibrary API
 * Search for books based on title, author, or subject
 * Add and delete books from a list of completed reads
 * See stats about your reading habits: 
    * Total books
    * Total pages
    + Average pages
    * Average book age
    * Favorite subjects


## How To Use: 
Use the search bar at the top right of the screen to search for a book. Use the drop down to select whether you want to serach by title, author, or subject. 

Scroll through the search results to find the book you want to add to your read list; add to the list using the "Add Read" button. You will not be able to enter the same book twice. 

As you add books to your queue, your stats will update on the far right of the screen. 

If you need to delete a book mistakenly added to your list, use the X button above a book to remove it from the list and from your stats.
